1) It read the program line by line.

2) It translates only one line of program at a time into machine code.

3) It produces intermediate code after translation.

4) It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code.

5) It is slower.

6) It requires less memory space.

7) It is good for beginners.

8) Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreter.

Compiler


1) It read the whole program at a time.

2) It translates the whole program at a time into machine code.

3) It produces machine code which is directly understood by computer.

4) It takes large amount of time to analyze the source code.

5) It is faster.

6) It requires more memory space.

7) It is good for professionals.
